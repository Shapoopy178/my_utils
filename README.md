# my_utils

my_utils is a collection of utility functions which have proven useful enough
to merit preservation in a centralized repository. They are stored to GitLab
in the interest of convenience to my own uses. They are, as a result, freely
available for general public use without expectation of support or documentation.

## Installation

Most of the modules required to use these functions are included with base 
Python 3.6. The further majority of nonstandard packages is included with the
Anaconda distribution of Python, so installation of the Anaconda distribution
is recommended for optimal performance.
