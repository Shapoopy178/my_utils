# my_utils

my_utils is a collection of utility functions which have proven useful enough to merit preservation in a centralized repository. They are hosted on GitHub purely in the interest of convenience for my own uses. They are, as a result, freely available for general public use without expectation of support or documentation.

## Installation

Most of the modules required to use these functions are included with the standard libraries of Python 3.6. The further majority of nonstandard packages is included with the Anaconda distribution of Python, so installation of the Anaconda distribution is recommended for optimal performance.
